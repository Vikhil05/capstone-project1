# My First Capstone Project

Hello! This is my very first capstone project. I created this project using only basic HTML tags.

I am excited to start my journey in web development, and this project is the first step toward building a strong resume and improving my skills.

I am looking forward to doing more creative and technical projects like this in the future.

## Project Goals

- Learn and apply basic HTML
- Create a simple and clean webpage
- Understand how to write a basic README in HTML

## What I Learned

- Using basic HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.
- Structuring a simple web page
- Writing a self-explanatory README file
- I also learned about proper indentation and how to organize files and use correct file paths in an HTML project.

## About Me

I am passionate about technology and development. I am currently learning full-stack web development and looking forward to building more projects and gaining real-world experience.

## Future Plans

- Improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills
- Build interactive and responsive websites
- Work on more capstone projects to enhance my portfolio
