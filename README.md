# My First Capstone Project

Hello! This is my very first capstone project. I created this project using only basic HTML tags.


## Project Goals

- Learn and apply basic HTML
- Create a simple and clean webpage

## What I Learned

- Using basic HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.
- Structuring a simple web page
- Writing a self-explanatory README file
- I also learned about proper indentation and how to organize files and use correct file paths in an HTML project.

**Thank you for visiting my project!**
